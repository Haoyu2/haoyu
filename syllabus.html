      <li>Note: in cases of grading problems with any of these submissions
        (similarity to other student's work for example), you may be asked to
        explain your answers after they are turned in. Also see Honesty just
        below.</li>


          <br><br>
    <h2>Honesty</h2>
    <p>You must do your own work in this course. You are encouraged to discuss
      problems/projects with classmates, or to ask for help with debugging. When
      you do share ideas or get help you must acknowledge that help in writing.
      However <b>IT IS NOT ALLOWED TO USE ANOTHER STUDENTS CODE IN ANY WAY
        WHILE DOING YOUR HOMEWORK</b>, even if you acknowledge that. Solutions
      from previous classes are similarly off-limits. </p>

        <a href="https://www.swamiiyer.net/cs210/cs210_collaboration.pdf">collaboration
          policy for cs210</a> is equally relevant to cs310. Please read it. It
        was written by Swami Iyer based on earlier versions of Ethan Bolker and
        Carl Offner. In addition to what's listed there, it is against the rules
        to post answers or partial answers in any place accessible to other
        students, for example as "backup". Make sure your backup area is
        private.</span></p>
    <p>For cheaters (including sources of copying), I have a second-strike
      policy. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>First strike – you get a 0 on the submission and a warning.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Second strike – you fail the course + a report to the higher
          administration</p>

    <h3><b>Working from home</b></h3>
    <p>All the software you need to work from home is available for free.&nbsp;
      We have written a primer on setting up your home system (<a href="DevelopmentSetup.html">DevelopmentSetup</a>).
      Warning: In the past, many students have had problems setting up their
      home computers. We will provide some informal help with this task (and
      some of you may be able to help others) but we cannot provide serious
      technical support for your home computer. Difficulties you encounter
      working from home will not be accepted as excuses for late assignments. Be
      sure to maintain backups of your work. Development work can be done on our
      Linux systems if necessary, but it is generally more efficient to use an
      IDE on a local computer.</p>
    <h3 class="unnumbered" id="unix-accounts-class-email">UNIX accounts, class
      email</h3>
    <p>You can do all your work on the Department’s network of Unix systems, or
      you can work on your home computer and deliver projects to the
      Department’s systems, but be sure to test them there. Either way, you need
      an account for cs310 at our site. Our class documents will be available at
      our class homepage, <a href="http://www.cs.umb.edu/cs310"><code>http://www.cs.umb.edu/cs310</code></a>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Apply for an account for cs310 as soon as possible, following the
          instructions listed in <a href="https://www.cs.umb.edu/sp/resources/other/faqs/">FAQ#02
            on the departmental website</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Your official email address for the class is that of your UMB student
          account, of form xxx.yyy00z@umb.edu. Please check this often,
          especially before due dates. You can forward it to to another email or
          to text message, for example, use forwarding email of format
          6173544223@vtext.com for a Verizon phone, for others see <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/microsoft-office/use-outlook-to-send-e-mail-to-a-cell-phone/">article</a>.</p>

      <li>
        <p>A Piazza group is available for student questions, etc. It sends
          email to your umb.edu mailbox.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Classes and Zoom</h3>
    <p>Zoom classes (as Zoom meetings) will follow the normal class schedule, MW
      12:30-1:45. The slides for these classes will be available on the class
      website. Find the meeting id and passcode from your UMB email. Please join
      the class with audio off on your device and turn audio and video on
      temporarily for communication such as asking questions. I'll pause for
      questions periodically, but you can also interject something if I'm going
      too fast. Hopefully I'll see you when you turn on the video, but the class
      is too big to fit on one screen, so you may have to speak up to get my
      attention. </p>
    <p>You need video capability with Zoom for exams and office hours, but not
      classes, except for the first two classes, where I would like to see you
      when you answer the roll call. If this is a problem for you, please email
      me about it. Note that the video from these classes and exams will not be
      made public, and is protected during the period by the passcode. Do not
      post the passcode so we won't be "Zoom bombed".</p>
    <p>Here is the guidance from the Administration on exams: Exams and
      assessment measures in this course will be proctored using an online
      method or service. Proctoring will require students to be video recorded
      and may require them to show their student ID at the start of the exam.
      Students should address any concerns they have regarding proctoring with
      their instructor prior to the add/drop deadline. </p> -->



    <h3>Accommodations</h3>
    <p>The University of Massachusetts Boston is committed to providing
      reasonable academic accommodations for all students with
      disabilities.&nbsp; This syllabus is available in alternate format upon
      request. Students with disabilities who need accommodations in this course
      must contact the instructor to discuss needed accommodations.
      Accommodations will be provided after the student has met with the
      instructor to request accommodations. Students must be registered with the
      Ross Center for Disability Services, UL 211, www.ross.center@umb.edu ,
      617.287.7430 before requesting accommodations from the instructor.</p>
